# Cat vs Dog Classifier

This is a simple Cat vs Dog image classifier implemented in Google Colab using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of labeled images of cats and dogs.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of thousands of images of cats and dogs. It is divided into training and validation sets for model training and evaluation.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture used for this classifier consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The final output layer uses a softmax activation function to classify images into cat or dog categories.

## Training

The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras in Google Colab. Training involves optimizing the model parameters to minimize the classification loss.

## Usage

To use this classifier, simply provide an image containing either a cat or a dog to the trained model, and it will predict whether the image contains a cat or a dog along with the confidence score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Google Colab (optional, for training)
